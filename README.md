Assignment 2:
  Levels completed:
    Level 1: Yes.
    Level 2: Yes.
    Level 3: No.

AI Reflection:
  Level 1:
    I used Copilot to get a single file with all the classes, afterwards I took out the different classes and put them into their own files and switched to private String name from protected void name. The only other time I used AI in this project was for quick bug fixes in the Main class.
  Level 2:
    I did not use any AI to complete level two because everything I neded was already there, I just had to copy and refactor to the guidlines of level 2.
